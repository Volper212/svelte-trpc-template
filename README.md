# svelte-trpc-template

Template for creating web apps with Svelte, tRPC and MongoDB.

Authentication included.

Authentication functionality was taken from a friend and refactored to fit to the project's structure (tRPC etc.) and coding style.

## Setup

```
pnpm i
```

You need to have the `mongod` daemon (from MongoDB) running every time you start the app.

## Development

```
pnpm dev
```

## Running for production

```
pnpm start
```
